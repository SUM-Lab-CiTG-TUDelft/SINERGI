## 🎯 About SINERGI
SINERGI develops innovative methods and digital tools to enable the sustainable integration of transport and energy systems.  
The project brings together academic, industrial, and public partners to explore solutions for:
- Shared and electric micro-mobility
- Data-driven forecasting and optimization
- Energy–mobility system integration
- Sustainable urban transport planning

*SUM LAB Leaders*

- **Dr. Shadi Sharif Azadeh**: Project Coordinator Europe
- **Dr. Gonçalo Correia**: Co – Principal Investigator and WP 2 leader
- **Dr. Yousef Maknoon**: Co – Principal Investigator and WP 4 leader

*SUM LAB Researchers*
- **Dr. Dongyang Xia**: Dongyang develops optimization frameworks for platform-based urban logistics, focusing on the integration of assortment design, dynamic restaurant ranking, and courier routing. His research highlights how incorporating customer choice behavior, congestion effects, and fairness-aware rider planning can enhance both platform profitability and service equity.
- **Dr. Kuldeep Kavta**: Kuldeep's research focuses on behavior modeling of riders and consumers in the online food delivery context, with an emphasis on enhancing rider safety and reducing the risk of road crashes.
- **Dr. Serkan Ozdemir**: Serkan is working on agent-based modeling to simulate micro-delivery services. His research aims to develop a decision support platform with a focus on real-life conditions and scenarios considering behavioral aspects of agents.
